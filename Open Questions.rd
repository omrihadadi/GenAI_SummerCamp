Question #1
### If given more time, several optimizations and enhancements could be made to the GenAI Summer Camp Assistant for a better user experience and improved system architecture. Here are some potential optimizations:
1. Database Integration:
Instead of storing parent data in memory, a proper database could be used. This would enable data persistence across sessions.
2. Error Handling:
Implement advanced error handling to better manage unexpected inputs or situations, ensuring the assistant does not crash or respond inappropriately.
Provide better feedback to users when they provide information outside the expected range or format.
3. Web Interface:
Build a web-based interface for the assistant so users can interact via a GUI. This could offer a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

Question #2
Testing the performance of conversational AI prompts is essential to ensure accuracy, reliability, and user satisfaction.
1.Unit Testing:
Test each prompt function individually to ensure they produce expected outputs for given inputs.
Ensure the router function correctly categorizes user input into "question" or "sign_up".
Check that the validation for the child's age works correctly.
2.Performance Testing:
Check the response time of the prompts. How long does it take for the assistant to respond to user inputs?
If integrated into a larger system or a web interface, assess system performance under load. For example, what if many users try to access the assistant simultaneously?

Question #3
1.Complex Queries: If a user asks multiple questions in a single query or combines a sign-up request with a question, the router may get confused.
2.Ambiguous Responses: Phrases like "maybe", "I think so", or "probably" might not be clearly categorized by the router.
3.Age Input Variations: Users might input age as "10 years", "10 yrs", "ten years old", etc. The current system might not handle all these variations.
